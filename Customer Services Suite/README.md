# Customer Services Suite
#### Release version 1.0 

## About the Customer Services Suite
The 'Customer Services Suite’ is collection of APIs designed to be used together — Account, Address, Bank, Contact, Customer, Name and Period. It is 
important to understand the dependencies between these when deciding which ones to implement, how to correctly sequence their adoption, how authorisation rules 
impact access, and how to use them in general.
